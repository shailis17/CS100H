#1: If you forget the parentheses in a print statement,
the interpreter gives you a SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
#2: If you forget one of the quotes when printing a string
the interpreter gives you a SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal.
If you forget both quotes, you are given a NameError as the interpreter reads
the input as undefined variable instead of a string.
#3: Python reads a plus sign next to a number as a positive number so the
arithmetic expression 2++2 is read as 2+(+2) and prints out a 4
#4: Python does not permit leading zeros in decimal integer literals so if your
input is 011 you will get a syntax error
#5: Python gives you SyntaxError if you forget the operator between two values

#1: The assignment 42 = n will not work as 42 is consisdered a literal.
#2: x = y = 1 is a valid way to declare two variables x and y and set them both
equal to 1
#3: Python can read statements with semicolons but they are not required
#4: Python will throw an error if you end a statement with a period unless the
statement ends with an int data type. If you write the assignment x = 3. for
example, python will turn the 3 into a 3.0 instead.
#5: Attempting to multiply two variables x and y as xy will give you a NameError.
